The most important thing to understand about React Router v5 is how composable it is. React Router doesn‚Äôt give you a house - it gives you some nails, screws, plywood, and a hammer while trusting that you can do the rest. A more technical way to say that is React Router v4 gives you the routing primitives upon which you can build your app. This concept really shines in the example we‚Äôre going to build.

What we want to do is create our own ‚Äúold school‚Äù navbar. Basically what that means is we‚Äôll add a ‚Äú>‚Äù to the front of whatever Link is active. If our two routes were / and /about, the two states of our navbar would look like this

> Home
About
Home
> About
First, the easy part. Let‚Äôs build the skeleton of the app by building out our Routes and the components we‚Äôll be rendering, Home and About.

import * as React from 'react'
import {
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Route,
  Link
} from 'react-router-dom'

const Home = () => <h2>Home</h2>
const About = () => <h2>About</h2>

export default function App () {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        {/* Links */}

        <hr/>

        <Route exact path="/"><Home/></Route>
        <Route path="/about"><About/></Route>
      </div>
    </Router>
  )
}
üíª Play with the code.

Beautiful. Now we need to implement our custom Link component - we‚Äôll call it OldSchoolMenuLink. The goal is to make the code below work properly. Notice it‚Äôs the OldSchoolMenuLink that will be in charge of adding and removing the > but its API is the same as Link.

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        <OldSchoolMenuLink exact={true} to="/">
          Home
        </OldSchoolMenuLink>
        <OldSchoolMenuLink to="/about">
          About
        </OldSchoolMenuLink>

        <hr />

        <Route exact path="/"><Home /></Route>
        <Route path="/about"><About /></Route>
      </div>
    </Router>
  )
}
First, let‚Äôs do the easy part. We know what props OldSchoolMenuLink is going to be taking in, so we can build out the skeleton of the component.

function OldSchoolMenuLink ({ children, to, exact }) {}
Now the main question is, what is it going to render? Remember, the whole point of this component is to make this navbar UI work (based on the active route)

> Home
About
Home
> About
With that said, we know we‚Äôre going to render a Link and if the app‚Äôs current location matches the Links path, we‚Äôll pre-pend it with a >.

Now the next question naturally becomes, how do we find out if the ‚Äúapp‚Äôs current location matches the Link's path‚Äù? Here‚Äôs one approach. We know the Links path because we‚Äôre passing it in as the to prop. We also know the app‚Äôs location because we can use window.location.pathname. With that said, we might implement OldSchoolMenuLink like this.

function OldSchoolMenuLink ({ children, to, exact }) {
  const match = window.location.pathname === to

  return (
    <div className={match ? 'active' : ''}>
      {match ? '> ' : ''}
      <Link to={to}>
        {children}
      </Link>
    </div>
  )
}
Well, this seems to work. The problem is it‚Äôs not really the React or React Router way of doing things. It also feels weird to reach out to the window object to get the app‚Äôs location. There‚Äôs a better way and it involves a tool that we already have at our disposal, React Router‚Äôs useRouteMatch custom Hook.

useRouteMatch gives you information on how (or if) the Route matched. Typically you invoke it with no arguments to get the app‚Äôs current path and url. In our case, instead of just getting the current path and url, we want to customize it to see if the app‚Äôs path matches OldSchoolMenuLink's to prop. If it does we want to pre-pend > and if it doesn‚Äôt we won‚Äôt. To tell useRouteMatch what we want to match for, we can pass it an object with a path prop and an exact prop.

function OldSchoolMenuLink ({ children, to, exact }) {
  const match = useRouteMatch({
    exact,
    path: to,
  })

  return (
    <div className={match ? 'active' : ''}>
      {match ? '> ' : ''}
      <Link to={to}>
        {children}
      </Link>
    </div>
  )
}
üíª Play with the code.

Just like that, we‚Äôve created our own Link component and used React Router‚Äôs useRouteMatch custom Hook to do some path checking for us.

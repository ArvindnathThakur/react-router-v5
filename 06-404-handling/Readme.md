A common use case for when you‚Äôre building a web app is to have a ‚Äúcatch all‚Äù route that will be rendered if none of your other routes match. A common example of this would be a 404 page.

To see how this works with React Router v5, let‚Äôs first render a navbar with the following paths - /, /will-match, /will-not-match, and /also/will/not/match.

import * as React from 'react'
import {
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Route,
  Link
} from 'react-router-dom'

export default function App () {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li><Link to="/">Home</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/will-match">Will Match</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/will-not-match">Will Not Match</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/also/will/not/match">Also Will Not Match</Link></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </Router>
  )
}
üíª Play with the code.

Now that we have the navbar set up, let‚Äôs create three different components to render - Home, which will match on /, WillMatch which will match on /will-match, and NoMatch, which will be the catch-all component which will render only if none of the other Route's match.

const Home = () => <h1>Home</h1>

const WillMatch = () => <h3>Matched!</h3>

const NoMatch = () => {
  const { pathname } = useLocation()

  <h3>No match for <code>{pathname}</code></h3>
}
üíª Play with the code.

Now that we have the components which are going to be rendered, we need to actually render some Routes. Home and WillMatch are straight forward, you just render them as you normally would.

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li><Link to="/">Home</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/will-match">Will Match</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/will-not-match">Will Not Match</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/also/will/not/match">Also Will Not Match</Link></li>
        </ul>

        <Route path="/" exact>
          <Home />
        </Route>
        <Route path="/will-match">
          <WillMatch />
        </Route>
      </div>
    </Router>
  )
}
üíª Play with the code.

Now the question becomes, how do we render NoMatch? Remember, we only want to render NoMatch if both the / and /will-match Routes don‚Äôt match. There are two parts to accomplishing this - the first is to render a Route that will always match. We can do this by passing * to the Routes path prop.

<Route path="/" exact>
  <Home />
</Route>
<Route path="/will-match">
  <WillMatch />
</Route>
<Route path='*'>
  <NoMatch />
</Route>
üíª Play with the code.

That‚Äôs closer, but if you play around with the app, you know we‚Äôre not done yet. Now the app renders the Home and WillMatch components properly but it also always renders the NoMatch component no matter what path we‚Äôre on.

What we need is a way to tell React Router v5 that we only want to render the first Route that matches - even if there‚Äôs more than one match. By doing this, our NoMatch component will only get rendered if the two Routes above it, / and /will-match aren‚Äôt matched.

The good news is React Router v5 comes with a component that does exactly this and it‚Äôs called Switch. By wrapping your Routes inside of Switch, React Router v5 will only render the first Route that matches.

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li><Link to="/">Home</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/will-match">Will Match</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/will-not-match">Will Not Match</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/also/will/not/match">Also Will Not Match</Link></li>
        </ul>

        <Switch>
          <Route path="/" exact>
            <Home />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/will-match">
            <WillMatch />
          </Route>
          <Route path='*'>
            <NoMatch />
          </Route>
        </Switch>
      </div>
    </Router>
  )
}
üíª Play with the code.

Now if the user isn‚Äôt at / or /will-match, the NoMatch component will be rendered.

You can utilize this same pattern to render a client-side 404 page if none of your other Routes match.

<Switch>
  <Route exact path="/"><Home /></Route>
  <Route path="/profile"><Profile /></Route>
  <Route path='*'><FourZeroFour /></Route>
</Switch>
